Eventory is a **desktop app for managing contacts and events, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
