* This is **project for event organisers and planners**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point for managing a multitude of contacts related to event planning
  * as a tool for organising large-scale events 
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Eventory_) used for organising contacts and tasks related to events.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Eventory`
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Eventory Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t12-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
